## Introduction

SME is Arm's architecture extension that provides optimal support for matrix operations that is crucial in AI workloads. The key features that comes in SME are:
- Streaming SVE mode
- Matrix multiplication / outer product between two vectors
- Matrix "tile" storage
- Manipulate data (load, store, insert) in tiles


## Concepts

SME introduces two fundamental concepts of "Streaming mode" and "ZA storage" that are crucial to operate on AI workloads. 

To understand the "Streaming mode", let us revisit some background about Scalable Vector Extension (SVE).
The SVE1 and SVE2 introduced the concept of "scalable vector registers". The size of these register or in other words, vector length (VL) can vary between 16B ~ 256B, depending on the hardware vendor. For e.g. Microsoft Azure's Cobalt offering the VL as 16B, Amazon AWS's Graviton3 has 32B while Fujitsu A64FX's Fugaku supercomputer has 64B vector length. During compilation, the VL can be known by querying the OS APIs (JIT) or by specifying the target hardware's VL upfront (AOT). Let us call the VL in SVE1/SVE2 as "non-streaming VL" or NSVL. SME introduces the concept of "streaming mode" where a program can execute in an environment in which the VL can be different than NSVL. The VL in streaming mode is typically referred as Scalable Vector Length or SVL. Since Arm architecture allows SVE1/SVE2/SME features to be available as part of same hardware, it means at one point, a program can be operating on a NSVL, while other times, it can be operating on SVL. There are instructions to turn the streaming mode ON/OFF. To add to the complexity, SME core is a separate unit on a chip (and hence is allowed to have different VL), some SVE1/SVE2/NEON instructions are invalid when the program is running in "Streaming mode". Much care is needed to ensure that developer is not executing non-streaming code while streaming mode is ON. 

SME introduces the concept of "streaming mode". A program can enter or leave streaming mode via the `SMSTART`/`SMSTOP` instructions. Most other SME instructions can only be run inside streaming mode. In all current implementations, the SME core is a separate unit on a chip which is switched to when entering streaming mode. Since this is a separate unit, the VL can be different than NSVL. The VL in streaming mode is typically referred as Scalable Vector Length or SVL. In addition, some SVE1/SVE2/NEON instructions are invalid when the program is running in "Streaming mode".

Since Arm architecture allows SVE1/SVE2/SME features to be available as parts of the same hardware, it means at one point, a program can be operating on a NSVL, while other times, it can be operating on SVL. Much care needs to be taken to ensure that non-streaming code does not get executed when streaming mode is ON.

`FEAT_SME_FA64` feature, if present will have SME unit on the CPU itself (configuration on the right) and hence no instructions become illegal, but it might not get implemented for server SKUs because of space it takes on the silicon for SME unit on every core. This needs confirmation though from Arm. That leaves us with the option of shared SME for all or portion of CPUs (configuration on the left) and that might be more for PC, laptop, mobile devices. M4 is the only production ready device, but that just have SME and no SVE feature.

The standard SME setup is one shared SME unit between all or subset of CPUs (configuration on the left). That is aimed more for PC, laptop, and mobile devices. M4 is the only production ready device - that just has SME and but no SVE features in the main CPU cores.

The second concept that SME introduces is `ZA storage` which is a 2D matrix of size `N x N`, where `N` is SVL (Note: it is SVL and not NSVL). This matrix is only available in streaming mode and the instructions to read/write/manipulate the ZA storage need to be executed in streaming mode. Just like NEON registers or Scalable registers, the contents of ZA storage matrix can be interpreted as 1-byte `B`, 2-bytes half `H`, 4-bytes single `S`, 8-bytes double `D` or 16-bytes quad `Q`.

### Terminology

- Non-streaming mode: Default execution
- Streaming mode: PE is set to be in streaming mode after `SMSTART` instruction and before `SMSTOP` instruction is executed for that thread.
- NSVL: Non-streaming Vector Length. Length of vector when program is operating in non-streaming mode.
- SVL: Streaming Vector Length. Length of vector when program is operating in streaming mode.
- VL-dependent objects: Objects whose size is different in streaming vs. non-streaming mode.

## Streaming mode

The processor can be in streaming mode or in non-streaming mode. Switching the PE to/from streaming mode has two outcomes:
- The length of SVE vectors and predicates switches. `NSVL` for non-streaming mode, `SVL` for streaming mode.
- Some instructions can operate only in streaming mode, referred to as "streaming instructions", while some can operate only in non-streaming mode, referred to as "non-streaming instructions". Finally, some can operate in either of the two modes and referred as "streaming compatible instructions".

A program is invalid and will have undefined behavior if "streaming instructions" are run in non-streaming mode or vice-versa.

<i>In both cases, these changes of mode are automatic and it is the compilerâ€™s responsibility to insert the necessary instructions. There are no C++ intrinsics that map directly to `SMSTART` and `SMSTOP`.</i>

### C++ ACLE


C++ defines function attributes `__arm_streaming` that says that everything in this function should be streaming instructions only. `__arm_streaming_compatible` says that it can have both streaming and non-streaming instructions. The clang generates the required `SMSTART` and `SMSTOP` in prolog/epilog depending on the atttribute. By default (if no attribute is specified), it is considered to be non-streaming mode. If there is a function call from streaming to non-streaming, compiler should inject the required `SMSTART` and `SMSTOP` instruction:

```c++
void n_print_sme_status(void)
{
   printf ("__arm_in_streaming_mode = %d \n", __arm_in_streaming_mode());
}

void s_print_sme_status(void) __arm_streaming 
{
   // SMSTART - injected by compiler
   // ...
   // some streaming code
   // ...
   // SMSTOP - injected by compiler
}

void sc_print_sme_status(void) __arm_streaming_compatible
{
   // if streaming==OFF, SMSTART ; injected by compiler
   // streaming instruction
   // ...
   // some more streaming
   // if streaming==ON, SMSTOP    ; injected by compiler
   printf ("__arm_in_streaming_mode = %d \n", __arm_in_streaming_mode());
   // more non-streaming
   // ...
   // if streaming==ON, SMSTART ; injected by compiler
   // streaming instruction
   //
   // DO not change the SM state
}
```

#### Example 1

Let us take a look at [this example](https://godbolt.org/z/aG471E5aM). 

- `n_print_sme_status()` is a regular non-streaming method.
- `n_to_s()` is a regular non-streaming method that calls streaming method `bar()`. Here, we see that compiler added `smstart` before calling `bar()` and after the call, added `smstop` instruction.
- On the other hand, `s_to_n()` is a streaming method that calls non-streaming method `foo()`. Here, we see, that compiler first added `smstop`, followed by call to `foo()` and then `smstart` instruction. This is make sure that the streaming mode stays ON in `s_to_n` function, even though there are calls to non-streaming methods in between.
- Finally, `sc_to_n()` is a "arm_streaming_compatible" function that makes calls to both streaming and non-streaming function. Here, before calling streaming function, it will check if streaming mode is already ON (using `__arm_sme_state`) and turn it ON, if not ON already. Vice-versa, it preserves the value before turning it ON in `w19` and after the function (streaming or non-streaming) returns, wil restore the streaming mode. Thus in streaming-compatible functions, the modes are not turned ON and OFF automatically, but are done based on the current state of mode.

#### Example 2

Let us look at another example [here](https://godbolt.org/z/84Ebrcn5q).

- `z8~z23` and `p4~p15` are saved/restored before streaming mode state changes. The incurs significant performance penalty and hence changing streaming state frequently is not advisable.

### ABI

When entering and leaving streaming mode, all Z and P registers are trashed
<i>
  - When entering Streaming SVE mode (PSTATE.SM is changed from 0 to 1) or exiting Streaming SVE mode (PSTATE.SM is changed from 1 to 0), all of these registers are set to zero.
  - Some SVE2 instructions become illegal to execute in Streaming SVE mode:
    - Gather/scatter load/store SVE2 instructions 
    - SVE2 instructions that use First Fault Register 
    - Most NEON instructions become UNDEFINED
</i>


## ZA storage space

- vector arrays and tiles
- explain the concept on how to understand and remember


Assuming we have 128-bits / 16B SVL, here is the representation. Treat `n is from 0 thru 15`
- **BYTE**
  - <u>ZA array vector access</u>: The `byte` in ZA, are stored as [16x16] 8-bits elements, thus representing 256 `byte` elements in total. Each row is refered is `ZA.B[n]`, where `n` is a row index. For e.g. when `SVE=16B`, they are `ZA.B[0], ZA.B[1],...,ZA.B[15]`.
  - <u>ZA tile</u>: There is just 1 tile for `byte` and is representated as `ZA0.B`. The horizontal slices (row order) is accessed using `ZA0H.B[n]`. For e.g. in our case, it will be `ZA0H.B[0], ZA0H.B[1],...,ZA0H.B[15]`. Likewise, column major entries are accessed using vertical slices using notation `ZA0V.B[n]`.
- **SHORT**
  - <u>ZA array vector access</u>: The `short` in ZA, are stored as [16x16] 16-bits elements, thus representing 128 `short` elements in total. Each row is refered is `ZA.H[n]`, where `n` is a row index.For e.g. when `SVE=16B`, they are `ZA.H[0], ZA.H[1],...,ZA.H[15]`.
  - <u>ZA tile</u>: There are 2 tiles for `short` and are representated as `ZA0.H` and `ZA1.H`. The horizontal slices (row order) are accessed using terminology `ZA0H.H[n]` and `ZA1H.H[n]`. The access is alternate such that `ZA0H.H[0] => ZA.H[0], ZA0H.H[1] => ZA.H[2]` and so forth. Likewise, `ZA1H.H[0] => ZA.H[1], ZA1H.H[1] => ZA.H[3]`. In general we can formulate it like: `ZAkH.H[m] => ZA.H[2*m+k]`.

    The verticle slices `ZA0V.H[n]` accesses the top 8 rows of `ZA` storage in "column-major" order, while `ZA1V.H[n]` access the bottom 8 rows of `ZA` storage, again, in "column-major" order. They go from `ZA0V.H[0], ZA0V.H[1],..,ZA0V.H[7]` and likewise for `ZA1V.H[*]`.

## .NET Runtime

To add the SME support in .NET Runtime, there are lot of considerations that need to be evaluated, out of which the primary ones are:

- Switch streaming mode ON/OFF automatically
- Surfacing `ZA` storage using .NET APIs, if there is a need (which is unlikely).
- Runtime aspects
  - Exception Handling
  - Threads and SME state
  - NativeAOT and crossgen2 handling
  - .NET <--> PInvoke/System calls
  - Debugger and Profiler
  - Testability

Let us walk through each of the above points in depth.

### Streaming state change

As described above, C++ ACLE defines function atttributes like `arm_streaming` and `arm_streaming_compatible`. These attributes eases the compiler to decide if it needs to turn streaming mode ON or OFF.

#### 1. MethodAttribute

static analyzer (does everyone enables it?)

#### 2. Streaming Namespace

#### 3. RAII style `using`

#### 4. FFR style tracking

Similar to FFR where we store the state of SM in GPR and add checks like 
```
if (rax == 1)
{
  throw NotSupportedException();
}
non_streaming(); // 
```

#### 5. Expose StreamingON() and StreamingOFF()

 User can forget to do one thing or other.

### Restricting VL-dependent objects transfer between streaming states

how to restrict VL-dependent objects are not passed between either modes?


### Representation of ZA storage in .NET APIs

Need to come up with various naming strategy depending on if `ZA` is passed and if it is operating on single lane, etc. like having `_x2` or `_x4` suffix or `_vg2` or `_vg4` suffix or `_vg1x2`, `_vg2x2`, etc.

Refer: https://arm-software.github.io/acle/main/acle.html#sme-instruction-intrinsics

[SMLAL](https://docsmirror.github.io/A64/2023-06/smlal_za_zzi.html)
```
// SMLAL intrinsic for 2 quad-vector groups.
    void svmla_lane_za32[_s8]_vg4x2(uint32_t slice, svint8x2_t zn,
                                    svint8_t zm, uint64_t imm_idx)
      __arm_streaming __arm_inout("za");

```


### Exception Handling
- unwinding and what to track
- Care needs to be taken to restore `PSTATE.SM` and `PSTATE.ZA` when exception is thrown and during unwinding.


### NativeAOT
- Applicable for non-streaming as well as streaming

### Threads
- How the state is tracked

### .NET <--> PInvokes / System calls


### Debugger / Profiler

- Need to see if streaming mode can change while debugging or if the processor mode might sometimes be diï¬€erent from the one implied by the source code.
- The register or variable display logic in VS/windbg when in streaming vs. not.

### WIP

- Agnostic VL support
- Understanding SME's broader impact and design for .NET support

### TODO
- Need to come up with list of SVE instructions that are valid vs. invalid in streaming mode
- Understand ZA storage
- Come up with a scheme to handle various rules around `__arm_streaming` , `__arm_non_streaming` and `__arm_streaming_compatible`
- format it properly
- ZA lazy scheme: https://arm-software.github.io/acle/main/acle.html#sme-instruction-intrinsics

### Open Questions
- What happens when `Vector<T>` is created in streaming mode? Can we pass it around to non-streaming mode and vice-versa? 18.1.7 restricts VL-dependent arguments to be passed that way, but how to restrict them in C#?
