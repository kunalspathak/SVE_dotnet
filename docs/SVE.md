## Introduction

SME is Arm's architecture extension that provides optimal support for matrix operations that is crucial in AI workloads. The key features that comes in SME are:
- Streaming SVE mode
- Matrix multiplication / outer product between two vectors
- Matrix "tile" storage
- Manipulate data (load, store, insert) in tiles


## Concepts

SME introduces two fundamental concepts of "Streaming mode" and "ZA storage" that are crucial to operate on AI workloads. 

To understand the "Streaming mode", let us revisit some background about Scalable Vector Extension (SVE).
The SVE1 and SVE2 introduced the concept of "scalable vector registers". The size of these register or in other words, vector length (VL) can vary between 16B ~ 256B, depending on the hardware vendor. For e.g. Microsoft Azure's Cobalt offering the VL as 16B, Amazon AWS's Graviton3 has 32B while Fujitsu A64FX's Fugaku supercomputer has 64B vector length. During compilation, the VL can be known by querying the OS APIs (JIT) or by specifying the target hardware's VL upfront (AOT). Let us call the VL in SVE1/SVE2 as "non-streaming VL" or NSVL. SME introduces the concept of "streaming mode" where a program can execute in an environment in which the VL can be different than NSVL. The VL in streaming mode is typically referred as Scalable Vector Length or SVL. Since Arm architecture allows SVE1/SVE2/SME features to be available as part of same hardware, it means at one point, a program can be operating on a NSVL, while other times, it can be operating on SVL. There are instructions to turn the streaming mode ON/OFF. To add to the complexity, SME core is a separate unit on a chip (and hence is allowed to have different VL), some SVE1/SVE2/NEON instructions are invalid when the program is running in "Streaming mode". Much care needs to ensure that developer do not have non-streaming code does not get executed when streaming mode is ON.

The second concept that SME introduces is `ZA storage` which is a 2D matrix of size `N x N`, where `N` is SVL (Note: it is SVL and not NSVL). The instructions to read/write/manipulate the ZA storage needs to be executed in streaming mode. Just like NEON registers or Scalable registers, the contents of ZA storage matrix can be interpreted as 1-byte `B`, 2-bytes half `H`, 4-bytes single `S`, 8-bytes double `D` or 16-bytes quad `Q`.

### Terminology

- Non-streaming mode: Default execution
- Streaming mode: PE is set to be in streaming mode after `SMSTART` instruction and before `SMSTOP` instruction is executed for that thread.
- NSVL: Non-streaming Vector Length. Length of vector when program is operating in non-streaming mode.
- SVL: Streaming Vector Length. Length of vector when program is operating in streaming mode.
- VL-dependent objects: Objects whose size is different in streaming vs. non-streaming mode.

## Streaming mode

The processor can be in streaming mode or in non-streaming mode. Having PE run in streaming mode, it has three outcomes:
- It changes the length of SVE vectors and predicates and they switch from `NSVL` to `SVL`.
- Some instructions can operate only in streaming mode, referred to as "streaming instructions", while some can operate only in non-streaming mode, referred to as "non-streaming instructions".
- There can be instructions that can operate in either of the two modes and referred as "streaming compatible instructions".

A program is invalid and will have undefined behavior if "streaming instructions" are ran in non-streaming mode or vice-versa.

<i>In both cases, these changes of mode are automatic and it is the compilerâ€™s responsibility to insert the necessary instructions. There are no intrinsics that map directly to SMSTART and SMSTOP.</i>

### C++ ACLE


C++ defines function attributes `__arm_streaming` that says that everything in this function should be streaming instructions only. `__arm_streaming_compatible` says that it can have both streaming and non-streaming instructions. The clang generates the required `SMSTART` and `SMSTOP` in prolog/epilog depending on the atttribute. By default (if no attribute is specified), it is considered to be non-streaming mode. If there is a function call from streaming to non-streaming, compiler should inject the required `SMSTART` and `SMSTOP` instruction:

```c++
void n_print_sme_status(void)
{
   printf ("__arm_in_streaming_mode = %d \n", __arm_in_streaming_mode());
}

void s_print_sme_status(void) __arm_streaming 
{
   // SMSTART - injected by compiler
   // ...
   // some streaming code
   // ...
   // SMSTOP - injected by compiler
}

void sc_print_sme_status(void) __arm_streaming_compatible
{
   // if streaming==OFF, SMSTART ; injected by compiler
   // streaming instruction
   // ...
   // some more streaming
   // if streaming==ON, SMSTOP    ; injected by compiler
   printf ("__arm_in_streaming_mode = %d \n", __arm_in_streaming_mode());
   // more non-streaming
   // ...
   // if streaming==ON, SMSTART ; injected by compiler
   // streaming instruction
   //
   // DO not change the SM state
}
```

#### Note 1
https://godbolt.org/z/fY8hqahhW

- need to add `__arm_sme_state`
- only need to add `smstart` and `smstop` if in `__arm_streaming` / `__arm_streaming_compatible`. The later should check the status of `patate.sm` to turn on/off.
- If calling `__arm_streaming`, the caller adds `smstart` before the call and `smstop` after the call. Inside `__arm_streaming`, if there is call to non-streaming function, then the `__arm_streaming` function will add `smstop` before such function call and then `smstart` again. Basically, in `__arm_streaming` function, streaming should always be ON. If non-streaming function is called, streaming needs to turn OFF and then resume streaming when the IP comes back.
- However if calling `__arm_streaming_compatible`, then we do not need to add `smstart` and `smstop`. Instead, before making non-streaming call, it checks if streaming is ON and if yes, turns it OFF before proceeding. After the non-streaming function call returns, it will restore the streaming state. In short, it saves/restore the streaming state.

#### Note 2

https://godbolt.org/z/84Ebrcn5q

- need to double check what registers should be saved/restored
- for the intrinsics that loads into horizontal/vertical, it needs to do range checks

### ABI

When entering and leaving streaming mode, all Z and P registers are trashed
<i>
  - When entering Streaming SVE mode (PSTATE.SM is changed from 0 to 1) or exiting Streaming SVE mode (PSTATE.SM is changed from 1 to 0), all of these registers are set to zero.
  - Some SVE2 instructions become illegal to execute in Streaming SVE mode:
    - Gather/scatter load/store SVE2 instructions 
    - SVE2 instructions that use First Fault Register 
    - Most NEON instructions become UNDEFINED
</i>


## ZA storage space

- vector arrays and tiles
- explain the concept on how to understand and remember


Assuming we have 128-bits / 16B SVL, here is the representation. Treat `n is from 0 thru 15`
- **BYTE**
  - <u>ZA array vector access</u>: The `byte` in ZA, are stored as [16x16] 8-bits elements, thus representing 256 `byte` elements in total. Each row is refered is `ZA.B[n]`, where `n` is a row index. For e.g. when `SVE=16B`, they are `ZA.B[0], ZA.B[1],...,ZA.B[15]`.
  - <u>ZA tile</u>: There is just 1 tile for `byte` and is representated as `ZA0.B`. The horizontal slices (row order) is accessed using `ZA0H.B[n]`. For e.g. in our case, it will be `ZA0H.B[0], ZA0H.B[1],...,ZA0H.B[15]`. Likewise, column major entries are accessed using vertical slices using notation `ZA0V.B[n]`.
- **SHORT**
  - <u>ZA array vector access</u>: The `short` in ZA, are stored as [16x16] 16-bits elements, thus representing 128 `short` elements in total. Each row is refered is `ZA.H[n]`, where `n` is a row index.For e.g. when `SVE=16B`, they are `ZA.H[0], ZA.H[1],...,ZA.H[15]`.
  - <u>ZA tile</u>: There are 2 tiles for `short` and are representated as `ZA0.H` and `ZA1.H`. The horizontal slices (row order) are accessed using terminology `ZA0H.H[n]` and `ZA1H.H[n]`. The access is alternate such that `ZA0H.H[0] => ZA.H[0], ZA0H.H[1] => ZA.H[2]` and so forth. Likewise, `ZA1H.H[0] => ZA.H[1], ZA1H.H[1] => ZA.H[3]`. In general we can formulate it like: `ZAkH.H[m] => ZA.H[2*m+k]`.

    The verticle slices `ZA0V.H[n]` accesses the top 8 rows of `ZA` storage in "column-major" order, while `ZA1V.H[n]` access the bottom 8 rows of `ZA` storage, again, in "column-major" order. They go from `ZA0V.H[0], ZA0V.H[1],..,ZA0V.H[7]` and likewise for `ZA1V.H[*]`.

## .NET Runtime

### .NET APIs

#### Goal

#### Representation options
- namespace
- MethodAttribute + static analyzer
- Determine during compilation similar to FFR
- restrict that VL-dependent objects are not passed between either modes.

#### Representation of ZA storage in .NET APIs

Need to come up with various naming strategy depending on if `ZA` is passed and if it is operating on single lane, etc. like having `_x2` or `_x4` suffix or `_vg2` or `_vg4` suffix or `_vg1x2`, `_vg2x2`, etc.

[SMLAL](https://docsmirror.github.io/A64/2023-06/smlal_za_zzi.html)
```
// SMLAL intrinsic for 2 quad-vector groups.
    void svmla_lane_za32[_s8]_vg4x2(uint32_t slice, svint8x2_t zn,
                                    svint8_t zm, uint64_t imm_idx)
      __arm_streaming __arm_inout("za");

```

### Exception Handling
- unwinding and what to track
- Care needs to be taken to restore `PSTATE.SM` and `PSTATE.ZA` when exception is thrown and during unwinding.


### NativeAOT
- Applicable for non-streaming as well as streaming

### Threads
- How the state is tracked

### .NET <--> PInvokes

### .NET <--> System calls

### Debugger

- Need to see if streaming mode can change while debugging or if the processor mode might sometimes be diï¬€erent from the one implied by the source code.
- The register or variable display logic in VS/windbg when in streaming vs. not.

- SME FEAT_SME_FA64



various options:
- `using`
- `STREAMING_ON` and `STREAMING_OFF` APIs. User can forget to do one thing or other.
- Similar to FFR where we store the state of SM in GPR and add checks like 

```
if (rax == 1)
{
  throw NotSupportedException();
}
non_streaming(); // 
```
- Method attributes similar to ACLE, but how many static analyzers user run
